        Composable programs are easier to reason about. We may (confidentally) determine program behaviour by determining
        the behaviour of sub-programs -> fewer bugs.

        Composable programs scale indefinitely, by composing more and more sub-programs.

        There is no distinction between a "small" and a "large" application; only "smaller than" or "greater than".

            This is why we cannot (refusal) answer the ever common question, "Are there any large programs written using Functional Programming Language X?"
            It would be dishonest to answer it!
