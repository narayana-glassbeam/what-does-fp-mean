    <para>
      Purity leads to compositionality.
      <programlisting lang="Java">
  if(player.score > 0)
    player.setSwizzle(7);
  else
    player.setSwizzle(player.swizzle + 1);</programlisting>
      Analyse this program. It intertwines purity with impurity (<code>setSwizzle</code>).
      <programlisting lang="Java">
  S s = player.score > 0 ? 7 : player.swizzle + 1;
  player.setSwizzle(s);</programlisting>
      Now we have untangled it a little.

        <para>
          The effort required to construct this program should be proportional to the size of E. The extent to which this is true
          is the extent to which one achieves the central thesis of Functional Programming.

        <para>
          Identifying independent program parts requires very rigorous cognitive discipline and correct concept formation. This can be
          very (very) difficult after exposure to sloppy thinking habits.
